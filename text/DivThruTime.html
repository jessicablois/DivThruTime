<h1>Diversity through Time</h1>

<h3>Jessica L Blois and Stephen T. Jackson</h3>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>Understanding mechanisms of biodiversity change is important given the many factors that may influence future biodiversity. To provide a long term context for recent biodiversity changes, I investigate links between local biodiversity and environmental change over the past 21,000 years. </p>

<p><strong>Questions and predictions</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Question 1: Is pollen richness stable through time? Our expectation is that richness will accumulate in the late Pleistocene (at least in glaciated terrain), as taxa respond to environmental change following deglaciation. Whether richness levels off or continues to increase through the Holocene, and whether richness increases or decreases at unglaciated sites, are open questions. </p></li>
<li><p>Question 2: Are changes in pollen richness related to climate changes? If environmental fluctuations pace diversity change, there should be greater changes in richness with greater changes in climate.  But there are two components to climate change: the direction of cc and the magnitude of cc.</p>

<ul>
<li>Related to direction of climate change: Latitudinal diversity gradient, and previous work by Currie paper, shows that, in plants, there are more species in warmer places.  Thus, as climate warms, there should be more additions of species than removals.  Though Currie paper also shows that changes through time are more strongly related to the local spatial gradient rather than the overall LDG.</li>
<li>Related to rate of climate change: General: As climate change happens faster, there should be faster changes in species richness.  But, if cc happens too fast, then species may not be able to keep up.  So perhaps this leads to a threshold effect, where the rate of changes increases to some threshold, then remains stable despite the changes in climate?<br/></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Question 3: Are there spatial patterns to pollen richness change? Given the legacy of northern ice sheets, richness should increase more at northern sites than at southern sites. Furthermore, additions of taxa should generally be from taxa with more southerly distributions, while taxa that are extirpated should be centered to the north of sites.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>Methods</h3>

<p>We assembled records of fossil pollen genera from lake sediment cores in eastern North America and determined richness change at each site through time.  </p>

<p>Data assembly: We assembled records of fossil pollen genera from lake sediment cores in eastern North America using the Neotoma Paleoecology Database (<a href="http://www.neotomadb.org">www.neotomadb.org</a>) (Figure 1). We relied on the dataset of fossil pollen sites assembled by Blois et al. (2013) and further refined by Maguire et al. (in prep).  Final sites included in the dataset are given in Appendix XX. Age models for each site were based on Blois et al. (2011). Fossil pollen data were calculated as the abundance of each genus, relative to the total genus sum at each site; these data were then converted to presence-absence if they passed the 5% relative abundance threshold, based on the maximum abundance of the genus across sites in the present day (the optimal pollen abundance threshold determined by Nieto-Lugilde et al. (2015)). We restricted analyses to sites with at least six pollen samples. </p>

<p>Richness patterns: We use genus-level richness as a rough proxy for species richness or diversity. We first calculated genus richness at each site for each sampled time slice, then calculated mean genus richness across all sites for every 500 years from 21,000 years ago to the present (Figure 2). There was no relationship between genus richness and sample size through time. We then determined the site richness trajectoryâ€”that is, whether richness increased or decreased at the site through time.  We fit a simple linear model through the richness values and stored both the slope and p-value. </p>
