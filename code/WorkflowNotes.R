# Workflow
# 
# 1. Determine overall patterns of richness at each site, and mean richness changes among sites
# - Critical time periods: 17,000; 14,500; 12,000; 6,000; 0.
# 2.  Calculate rates of climate change.  Did more compositional change occurred between periods with more rapid climate change?
# 3.  What was the average direction and distance of colonization or extirpation?
